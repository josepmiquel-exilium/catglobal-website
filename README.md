The frontend of my company has been developed using pure React and Tailwind CSS, with no reliance on any UI components library. The design is clean, minimal, and professional, and has been crafted entirely by me. I'm pleased to offer the source code to you, with full permission to use and make modifications as desired.

The donation form has been specifically developed to operate with Stripe. If you are using an alternative payment gateway, modify the form to work with their API.
